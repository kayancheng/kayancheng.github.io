About me
--
Hi, this is Ka Yan from Hong Kong! I am currently a second year Ph.D. student at the [Economics department of Emory University](https://economics.emory.edu/index.html). Before joining Emory, I earned both my B.S.Sc. and M.Phil. in Economics from the [Chinese University of Hong Kong] (https://www.econ.cuhk.edu.hk/econ/en-gb/).

My research interests are econometrics and machine learning.
