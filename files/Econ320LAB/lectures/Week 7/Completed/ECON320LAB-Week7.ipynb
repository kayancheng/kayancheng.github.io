    "**Decision guide:**\n",
    "1. If a variable **affects wage** and is plausibly **correlated with `educ`** → **include it**.  \n",
    "2. If it is **caused by `educ`** → **omit it** for the total effect.  \n",
    "3. If it’s **redundant** (adds no new info) → you may drop it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In our example:**  \n",
    "- `ability` is a **true determinant** of wage and **correlated** with education.  \n",
    "- So, the **long model (with `ability`)** gives the **unbiased estimate** of the effect of education.  \n",
    "- The **short model** omits `ability` and thus **suffers OVB** — used here only for illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But what if “ability” is shaped by education?**  \n",
    "- If “ability” reflects **innate skills** or pre-education factors  → **include** it (or a proxy).  \n",
    "- If “ability” reflects **skills developed through schooling** → **omit** it if your goal is the **total effect** of education."
